      <p>
        A highly motivated Software developer with keen interest in developing
        business solutions and solving problems using web and mobile
        technologies. I develop industry standard and highly scalable
        applications using FastAPI, Django, Django REST framework(Python
        frameworks for building web applications and RESTful APIs), and React
        Native. I'm familiar with the design, development and deployment process
        of web-based/mpbile technologies. I take pride in learning, so I find it
        easy to pick up other web technologies/programming languages on the go.
